##Marry has been ill for three days

+ He has left EF since 2012
+ They have got married for 20 years
+ We have finished the project since 2 years ago

##Susan has been reading that storybook since last night.
format: sb have/has been doing sth for/since some time

+ I have been working for 42 hours


##现在完成进行时与现在完成时的比较：
>+ 相同点：
    当表示过去发生且一直持续到现在的动作时，两者通用；现在完成进行时只是现在完成时的一种强调时态而已。
    如

>   I have played for half an hour since I began to play tennis. 

>   I have been playing for half an hour since I began to play tennis.

>   两句意思相同，但第二句感情更加强烈

>+ 不同点：
   
>   (1)当表示过去发生的动作，已经完成，强调对现在产生的结果或影响时，只能用现在完成时。如 I have copied these problems.

>   (2)当使用现在完成进行时的时候，主句的谓v.要用延续性动词；而当使用现在完成时的时候，是否使用延续性动词，视具体情况而定。

>   (3)不能用于进行时的动词(如like, want等)，也不能用于现在完成进行时。而现在完成时无此限制。如

>    I have been liking her for a long time. × 

>    I have liked her for a long time. √
