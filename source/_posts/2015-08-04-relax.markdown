Do you always feel tired? 

Come to learn some skills to relax.

###Sleep

If you have not slept for a long time, such as 24 hours, the best way to relax for you is sleeping. So put down your works and go to bed.

###Wash the face

I always feel sleepy when I get up, I choose wash my face to wake up.

This way is still useful to relax in the work.

###Coffee

Coffee is usually useful for me to keep energy in the work.

###Meditation

I like the meditation very much, it's said that, "To do meditation for five minutes is equal to sleep for an hour". I'm not sure it is true, but it is completely useful to relax. Try it, and you'll like it, too.
