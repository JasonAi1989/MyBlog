In my cuontry, there are many strict laws about the driving, the strictest law is about driving alcohol. It is prohibited to drive after drinking the alcohol, even though a little alcohol. The driver might be lose his driving license if he is drunk while driving, or the   driver might be gave warning and lose 6 point (the point is used to indicate if the driver has the right to drive) if he drinks a little alcohol. In my opinion, I think the law is very useful to keep us safe and decrease the number of traffic accidents, but at the same time, it is a bit difficult to the drivers while they have drunk, maybe they should go home by texi.
