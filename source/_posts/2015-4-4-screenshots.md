Hi Deer:

Do you want to know how to take a screenshot on Ubuntu?

It is really easy...

This way is useful for gnome desktop.

command:
     gnome-screenshot  #it is full screenshot
     gnome-screenshot  #it is a part of screenshot

And we can add those commands to keyboard map.

Open the keyboard map in system setting menu.

Then, add those commands to it.
